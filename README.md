## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I changed from a static to a variable font file because the static files only contained higher weights, which were very different from the design prompt provided.

I intially struggled to achieve the desired 3D effect for the card. I tried using `border-style: outset`, but that still gave a 2D shape.

I also experimented with `box-shadow`, which added density to the shape, but the opacity didn't match the design prompt. After researching the `box-shadow` property on the W3Schools website, I set the blur to 0, which resulted in a block color.

Additionally, I encountered an issue where the illustration image overflowed into the padding of its parent container. Through research, I discovered that setting the `max-width` property helped keep the image within the confines of its parent divâ€™s content section.
